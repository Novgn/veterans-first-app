// Zustand application store — web.
//
// Story 4.1. This is the canonical global-state layer for the web workspace.
// Most per-feature state should stay in component state or server data — this
// store is reserved for cross-cutting UI preferences (theme, onboarding, etc.)
// that should persist between page loads.
//
// === Why `persist` with a `partialize` filter ===
// Zustand's `persist` middleware by default serializes the WHOLE state object
// to storage on every change. That is dangerous for ephemeral UI state: a
// `drawerOpen` flag would survive reloads and re-open the drawer on every
// visit, which is almost never what a user wants. `partialize` below picks the
// subset of fields that should actually be persisted, leaving ephemeral flags
// in memory only.
//
// === Why the no-op server storage fallback ===
// Next.js App Router evaluates this module from Server Components too
// (any import graph touching the store drags it onto the server). `localStorage`
// does not exist on the server, so reading it at module-eval time would crash
// the build. `createJSONStorage` accepts a storage **getter** — we return
// `undefined` on the server, which tells the middleware "skip persistence for
// now". Client-side hydration then resumes reads/writes normally.
